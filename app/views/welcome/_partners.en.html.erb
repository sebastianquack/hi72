<p><b>72 Hour Urban Action</b> is the world's first real-time architecture competition, where 10 international teams have 3 days and 3 nights to design and build projects in public space in response to local needs. The teams design, build, sleep and party on site to generate interventions in public space within an extreme deadline, a tight budget and limited space. 72 Hour Urban Action invites professionals and residents to become active agents of change, from the bottom-up, and to leave a lasting impact on the urban landscape.</p><p>The ﬁrst 72 Hour Urban Action competition took place in September 2010 as part of the Bat-Yam Biennale Landscape Urbanism. The Bat-Yam Biennale is a unique civic action model that encourages activist action in public space in collaboration with the local authorities.</p><p>72 HUA seeks ways to provide space for experimentation in public space, to involve alternative players in the creative process of urban design and to bridge the gap between planning and construction.</p><p><img src='assets/urban-action-logo-lo-res.jpg' width='150' alt='Urban Action Logo Lo Res'></p><p>For more information on 72 Hour Urban Action <a href='http://72hoururbanaction.com' target='_blank'>click here</a>.</p><p><b>Invisible Playground</b> is a collective of Berlin-based artists, game designers and academics.
