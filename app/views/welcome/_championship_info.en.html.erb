<h3>A World Championship</h3>
<p>How does it work? 5 teams take part in the challenge. Each of the 5 teams represents one city in the Ruhr Valley and consists of a mix of residents of the team’s city and participants joining from all over the world. During the World Championship, the teams take over a street in the hosting city and transform five neglected sites through gameful architecture interventions. The teams include game designers and architects, local craftspeople, international designers, Ruhr Valley residents engaged in clubs and associations as well as professional hobbyists. Tinkerers, gamers, designers, scenographers, philosophers and all DIY enthusiasts are invited to apply for the competition.</p>
<p>The teams only have 72 hours – three days and nights – to design and build the interventions – on site and in real-time. On launch day, the teams receive their missions for the first time and start to design a response to the site's potential and build it then and there in 1:1 scale. The teams have to handle challenges of no sleep, working with new people and around curious neighbours. This is an extreme version of home makeover, only outside and on the streets of a Ruhr Valley city.</p>
<p>You can apply as an individual or as a small team (up to six people). We connect individual applicants with other members to form teams of super powers and talents – worthy to represent 5 great cities of the Ruhr Valley.</p>
<p>Everyone can become a champion of our shared universe. But it is not easy. We all need inspiration, support, knowledge and a great team. Nothing happens if we do not challenge ourselves. Therefore, only one team can win the World Championship of 72 HOUR INTERACTIONS. Are you up for the challenge? Are you generous enough to contribute your skills to this shared adventure?</p>
