# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

  section_about_headline: "About the Project"
  section_about_content_html: "<p>This summer, for the first time in the history of the Ruhr Area and for the first time in history in general, one city will become the home of a cultural experiment transferring architecture and urban interventions into the realm of game design and vice versa. Get ready for 72 HOUR INTERACTIONS – A World Championship of Gameful Architecture.</p><p>Gameful Architecture can change the scale, feel and use of a public space. Gameful architecture questions the difference between a 'serious' use and a 'game'? Should cities separate these forms of use? Or should they teach a responsible, accountable, open way to play with the urban landscape?</p>"

  section_championship_headline: "A World Championship"
  section_championship_content_html: "<p>How does it work? 5 teams take part in the challenge. Each of the 5 teams represents one city in the Ruhr Valley and consists of a mix of residents of the team’s city and participants joining from all over the world. During the World Championship, the teams take over a street in the hosting city and transform five neglected sites through gameful architecture interventions. The teams include game designers and architects, local craftspeople, international designers, Ruhr Valley residents engaged in clubs and associations as well as professional hobbyists. Tinkerers, gamers, designers, scenographers, philosophers and all DIY enthusiasts are invited to apply for the competition.</p><p>The teams only have 72 hours – three days and nights – to design and build the interventions – on site and in real-time. On launch day, the teams receive their missions for the first time and start to design a response to the site's potential and build it then and there in 1:1 scale. The teams have to handle challenges of no sleep, working with new people and around curious neighbours. This is an extreme version of home makeover, only outside and on the streets of a Ruhr Valley city.</p><p>You can apply as an individual or as a small team (up to six people). We connect individual applicants with other members to form teams of super powers and talents – worthy to represent 5 great cities of the Ruhr Valley.</p><p>Everyone can become a champion of our shared universe. But it is not easy. We all need inspiration, support, knowledge and a great team. Nothing happens if we do not challenge ourselves. Therefore, only one team can win the World Championship of 72 HOUR INTERACTIONS. Are you up for the challenge? Are you generous enough to contribute your skills to this shared adventure?</p>"

A street with people from a broad range of backgrounds ready to take things into their own hands – and open to collaborate with people from the four other cities as well as from all around the world. A street with a wide range of atmospheres. A street facing various challenges. A street where we can create a camp for 50 international participants with enough space to work, play, cook and celebrate!</p>"

In February, a jury consisting of Urbane Künste Ruhr, 72 HOUR URBAN ACTION, Invisible Playground, as well as architect Nathalie Pozzi, game designer Eric Zimmerman, and urbanist Philipp Misselwitz reviewed the suggetions and research results. In a close call, the jury decided that Witten will host the Championship!</p><p>We are currently searching for a camp site in Witten and a set of microsites for the missions, chosen to reflect potentials and local needs. Micro-sites are big enough for the community to enjoy, but too small to be officially renovated: the gap between two buildings; a street corner where nothing ever grows; an empty space behind a bus stop; the abandoned lot next to the local store.</p>"
