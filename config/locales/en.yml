# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

  section_about_content_html: "<p>This summer, for the first time in the history of the Ruhr Area and for the first time in history in general, one city will become the home of a cultural experiment transferring architecture and urban interventions into the realm of game design and vice versa. Get ready for 72 Hour Interactions – A World Championship of Gameful Architecture.</p><p>Gameful Architecture can change the scale, feel and use of a public space. Gameful architecture questions the difference between a 'serious' use and a 'game'? Should cities separate these forms of use? Or should they teach a responsible, accountable, open way to play with the urban landscape?</p>"

  section_championship_headline: "A World Championship"
  section_championship_content_html: "<p>How does it work? 5 teams take part in the challenge. Each of the 5 teams represents one city in the Ruhr Valley and consists of a mix of residents of the team’s city and participants joining from all over the world. During the World Championship, the teams take over a street in the hosting city and transform five neglected sites through gameful architecture interventions. The teams include game designers and architects, local craftspeople, international designers, Ruhr Valley residents engaged in clubs and associations as well as professional hobbyists. Tinkerers, gamers, designers, scenographers, philosophers and all DIY enthusiasts are invited to apply for the competition.</p><p>The teams only have 72 hours – three days and nights – to design and build the interventions – on site and in real-time. On launch day, the teams receive their missions for the first time and start to design a response to the site's potential and build it then and there in 1:1 scale. The teams have to handle challenges of no sleep, working with new people and around curious neighbours. This is an extreme version of home makeover, only outside and on the streets of a Ruhr Valley city.</p><p>You can apply as an individual or as a small team (up to six people). We connect individual applicants with other members to form teams of super powers and talents – worthy to represent 5 great cities of the Ruhr Valley.</p><p>Everyone can become a champion of our shared universe. But it is not easy. We all need inspiration, support, knowledge and a great team. Nothing happens if we do not challenge ourselves. Therefore, only one team can win the World Championship of 72 HOUR INTERACTIONS. Are you up for the challenge? Are you generous enough to contribute your skills to this shared adventure?</p>"

  section_site_content1_html: "<p>Help us find just the right place for the championship! We are looking for: a street somewhere in Hagen, Hattingen, Herdecke, Wetter or Witten. A street with people from a broad range of backgrounds ready to take things into their own hands – and open to collaborate with people from the four other cities as well as from all around the world. A street with a wide range of atmospheres. A street facing various challenges. A street where we can create a camp for 50 international participants with enough space to work, play, cook and celebrate!</p>"

Micro-sites are big enough for the community to enjoy, but too small to be officially renovated: the gap between two buildings; a street corner where nothing ever grows; an empty space behind a bus stop; the abandoned lot next to the local store.</p><p>The city that will host the World Championship will be elected by a jury consisting of Urbane Künste Ruhr, 72 HOUR URBAN ACTION, Invisible Playground, Nathalie Pozzi (architect), Eric Zimmerman (game designer) and Phillip Misselwitz (urbanist). They will also serve as judges in the championship event. The hosting city will be announced on February 11.</p>"
  section_partners_headline: "The partners"
  section_partners_content_html: "<p><b>72 Hour Urban Action</b> is the world's first real-time architecture competition, where 10 international teams have 3 days and 3 nights to design and build projects in public space in response to local needs. The teams design, build, sleep and party on site to generate interventions in public space within an extreme deadline, a tight budget and limited space. 72 Hour Urban Action invites professionals and residents to become active agents of change, from the bottom-up, and to leave a lasting impact on the urban landscape.</p><p>The ﬁrst 72 Hour Urban Action competition took place in September 2010 as part of the Bat-Yam Biennale Landscape Urbanism. The Bat-Yam Biennale is a unique civic action model that encourages activist action in public space in collaboration with the local authorities.</p><p>72 HUA seeks ways to provide space for experimentation in public space, to involve alternative players in the creative process of urban design and to bridge the gap between planning and construction.</p><p><img src='assets/urban-action-logo-lo-res.jpg' width='150' alt='Urban Action Logo Lo Res'></p><p><b>Invisible Playground</b> is a collective of Berlin-based artists, game designers and academics. Formed in 2009, Invisible Playground creates site-specific games of various sizes and formats with a consistent theme of cultivating a new understanding of cities and society. Drawing from diverse influences ranging from experimental theater and performance art to pop fiction, sports, board and video games, the collective develops playful experiences that grant participants entry onto the invisible playgrounds they walk across every day without noticing. Next to the creation of games, workshops and playtesting events, Invisible Playground curates the Playpublik Festival. Invisible Playground have appeared by invitation at theatres, art spaces and festivals across Europe and beyond.</p><p><b>Urbane Künste Ruhr</b> is the new art organization in the cultural metropolis Ruhr. Based on the unique urban landscape of the Ruhr Area, Urbane Künste Ruhr together with artists, networks, and cultural institutions investigates the core of urbanity. Under the artistic direction of Katja Aßmann, Urbane Künste Ruhr develops and realizes projects that define the design of cities in a new way – always on-site and together with the people living here. Urbane Künste Ruhr risks a new perspective on the Ruhr Area, the city in general, and the possibilities of art.</p><p><img src='assets/logo-ukr.png' width='150' alt='Logo UKR'></p>"
