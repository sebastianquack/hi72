# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  section_about_content_html: "<p>This summer, for the first time in the history of the Ruhr Area and for the first time in history in general, one city will become the home of a cultural experiment transferring architecture and urban interventions into the realm of game design and vice versa. Get ready for 72 HOUR INTERACTIONS – A World Championship of Gameful Architecture.</p><p>Gameful Architecture can change the scale, feel and use of a public space. Gameful architecture questions the difference between a 'serious' use and a 'game'? Should cities separate these forms of use? Or should they teach a responsible, accountable, open way to play with the urban landscape?</p>"

  section_site_content1_html: "<p>In Janurary 2014, we asked you to help us find just the right place for the championship! A street somewhere in Hagen, Hattingen, Herdecke, Wetter or Witten. A street with people from a broad range of backgrounds ready to take things into their own hands – and open to collaborate with people from the four other cities as well as from all around the world. A street with a wide range of atmospheres. A street facing various challenges. A street where we can create a camp for 50 international participants with enough space to work, play, cook and celebrate!</p>"

In February, a jury consisting of Urbane Künste Ruhr, 72 HOUR URBAN ACTION, Invisible Playground, as well as architect Nathalie Pozzi, game designer Eric Zimmerman, and urbanist Philipp Misselwitz reviewed the suggetions and research results. In a close call, the jury decided that Witten will host the Championship!</p><p>We are currently searching for a camp site in Witten and a set of microsites for the missions, chosen to reflect potentials and local needs. Micro-sites are big enough for the community to enjoy, but too small to be officially renovated: the gap between two buildings; a street corner where nothing ever grows; an empty space behind a bus stop; the abandoned lot next to the local store.</p>"
